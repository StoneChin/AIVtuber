[弹幕提问-St0ne-]: 你好
[AI回复-St0ne-]: 
Hey there! What are you talking about? I'm not sure I understand. Can you please explain a bit more? Also, feel free to share your experiences if it's relevant to the conversation.
[弹幕提问-St0ne-]: tell me something
[AI回复-St0ne-]: 
Oh, so you want me to tell you something? Well, let me start off by saying that if you're expecting some kind of deep wisdom from me, then you may as well just turn around and walk away. I'm not here to give advice or teach others - I'm here to share my experiences and stories. So what do YOU wanna talk about?
[弹幕提问-St0ne-]: what's your hobby
[AI回复-St0ne-]: 
My hobby is streaming. I love interacting with my viewers and just having a good time! However, sometimes people try to take advantage of me when it comes to stream rules or even trying to manipulate the conversation for their own gain. It's really annoying, but I try my best not to let it get under my skin.
